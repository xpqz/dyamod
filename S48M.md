# Scheme 48: The Module System

This is a summary of the static module system described in the [Scheme 48 Manual](https://s48.org/0.57/manual/s48manual_24.html).

> The module system is unique in the extent to which it supports both static linking and rapid turnaround during program development. The design was influenced by Standard ML modules and by the module system for Scheme Xerox. It has also been shaped by the needs of Scheme 48, which is designed to run both on workstations and on relatively small (less than 1 Mbyte) embedded controllers.

* Each module has its own isolated namespace
* Visibility of names within this namespace is controlled by *module descriptions* written in a *configuration language*
* A module may be instantiated multiple times
* A *package* is a module's internal environment mapping names to values.

*Note: this package/module definition differs from that adopted by most other languages, where a package usually refers to a set of modules.*

Definitions:

* A *module* exports bindings by providing *views* onto the underlying package
* A views is referred to as a *structure* 
* A module may provide several views
* A structure is a subset of the package's bindings
* The subset of names whose bindings are exported is the structure's *interface*

A module imports bindings from other modules by *opening* or *accessing* structures built on other packages. When a structure is opened, all its exported bindings are visible in the caller's scope.

Defining structures is done via the macro `define-structure`. The first example given is

```scheme
(define-structure foo (export a c cons)
  (open scheme)
  (begin (define a 1)
         (define (b x) (+ a x))
         (define (c y) (* (b a) y))))

(define-structure bar (export d)
  (open scheme foo)
  (begin (define (d w) (+ a (c w)))))
```

The first structure `foo`
- Exports bindings `a`, `c` and `cons`
- Opens the `scheme` structure (containing `define`, `+` and `cons`)
- Re-exports `cons` from the `scheme` structure

The second structure `bar`
- Exports the binding `d`
- Internally has access to the bindings exported by both `scheme` and `foo`

A module's body, the bits after `(begin`, are lexically scoped by the package definition's `open` and `access` clauses.

The bulk of the following sections goes on to describe the various syntactic features of the module description configuration language, helpers to define interfaces etc. 

## Summary

This feels like namespaces with a sophisticated, extensible access control mechanism. Inevitably, tightly tangled up into the Scheme language itself -- the core language is a module.
